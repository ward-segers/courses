    "## Why should we learn Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The amount of data is exploding, we use more and more data.\n",
    "- Data drives the business decisions\n",
    "- It's important to correctly analyse and visualise the data\n",
    "- Tools and data are more accessible now\n",

    "## Basic concepts in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "- *variables*: general property of an object, allows to distinguish objects\n",
    "- *values*: specific property, interpretation of that object\n",
    "  - Example: variable: gender, value: male\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement levels\n",
    "\n",
    "> They refer to the types of variables in a dataset. And determine how data can be analyzed, visualized and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They help determine the most suitable method for analysis:\n",
    "  - visualization methods (Measurement levels help determine the most appropriate way to visualize the data)\n",
    "  - central tendency and dispersion (different levels of measurement allow for different statistical summaries)\n",
    "  - examine the relationship between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of measurement levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Qualitative***: \n",
    "  - not necessarily numeric values.\n",
    "  - limited number of values\n",
    "  - categories:\n",
    "    - *nominal* categories: e.g. gender, race, country, shape\n",
    "    - *ordinal* Order, rank: e.g. military rank, level of education\n",
    "- ***Quantitative***:\n",
    "  - Number with a unit of measurement\n",
    "  - Many values, often unique\n",
    "  - categories:\n",
    "    - *interval*: no fixed zero point ==> no proportion. e.g. C°, F°\n",
    "    - *ratio*: absolute zero point ==> proportions. e.g. distance (m), energy (j), weight (kg)\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Quantitative* variables often contain the results of a measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationship between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "> Variables are related if there values change **systematically**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Causal relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frustration leads to aggression\n",
    "- Alcohol leads to decreased alertness\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Cause* is the independent variable\n",
    "> *Consequence* is the dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample testing\n",
    "\n",
    "- *population*: the collection of all objects/people/... you want to investigate\n",
    "- *sample*: a subset of the population from which measurements will be taken\n",
    "\n",
    "> Under certain circumstances the results for the sample are representative for the population\n",
    "> A sample is easier to analyze than an entire population\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling method\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>Definition of the population</center>\n",
    "<center>↓</center>\n",
    "<center>Defining sample frame</center>\n",
    "<center>↓</center>\n",
    "<center>Choise of sampling frame (time and budget)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample types\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Random sample*: every element from the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample\n",
    "- *Non-random sample*: the elements for the sample are not randomly selected.\n",
    "  - Objects that are collected easily are more likely to be selected (**convenience sampling**)\n",
    "- *Stratified sampling*: population is devided into **strata** based on one or more *stratified variables*. A random sample is then taken from each stratum, either proportionally or equally, depending on the study's goals.\n",
    "  - Examples: \n",
    "    - Gender: Male, Female\n",
    "    - Age Groups: 18-25, 26-35, 36-50, 51+\n",
    "    - Income levels: Low, Medium, High\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible errors\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement in a sample will typically deviate from the value in the entire population and is therefor prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors can be:\n",
    "- Accidental or systematic\n",
    "- Sampling-error or non-sampling-error\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sampling-errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accidental sampling errors are pure coincidence\n",
    "- Systematic sampling errors\n",
    "  - Online survey: people without internet are excluded\n",
    "  - Street survey: only who is currently walking there\n",
    "  - Voluntary survey: only interesting parties participate\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-sampling errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accidental non-sampling errors\n",
    "  - Incorrectly ticked answers\n",
    "- Systematic non-sampling errors\n",
    "  - Poor or non-calibrated equipment\n",
    "  - Value can be influence by the fact that you measure\n",
    "  - Respondents lie"
